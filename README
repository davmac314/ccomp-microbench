This is a set of small compiler benchmarks.

It's in a rough state. There is no infrastructure - you have to individually
compile and run the benchmarks with the different compilers you are interested
in, and time the result. However, multiple people have expressed interest,
so I am making the code publicly available.

Each directory bm1..bm10 contains one benchmark test.

Typically, there is a "driver" program (driver.c) and an additional module
which is the benchmark itself (bm1.c, bm2.c, etc). The reason for having
two separate files is to prevent whole-program optimization that would skew
the results. To get a proper result you should:

 - compile the driver.c file *once* with compiler A, to produce a
   "driver.o" object file
 - compile the benchmark module (bmX.c) with each compiler you want to test
   and link the result with the driver.o file. eg:

	gcc -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -std=c99 driver.o bm1.c

 - run and time the result in each case:
	time ./a.out

 * Just to be clear, to compare two compilers, you should *not* recompile
   driver.c with the second compiler.
 * Note that the benchmarks are written in the C99 dialect.
 * Further information about individual benchmarks is usually in the
   comments in the bmX.c file
 * If anyone improves the infrastructure or comes up with interesting new
   test programs, I would appreciate being provided with patches.
